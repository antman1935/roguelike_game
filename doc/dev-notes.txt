Game Title:

     The game starts off with the player spawned on level 1. To progress to the
next level the player must kill enemies, which at the same time will earn them
experience to be used on upgrading their character's traits and skills. To win,
the player must defeat a currently unnamed enemy that will only spawn past
level 10. From then on, the chance that [boss name] will spawn will increase by
ten percent every time ten levels are finished. The player will be notified of
[boss name]'s spawning, and more than likely they will try to avoid him until
they feel ready to battle. So the game goes from simply attacking enemies and
leveling up, to still trying to level up and avoiding near certain death, to
finally chasing after [boss name]. To drive the middle stage of gameplay, the
likelihood of survival will be displayed with the notification of [boss name]'s
arrival.

Things to implement:

Move between levels:
Only one way. Certain level is reached, gate opens, maybe animated?

Boss Generation:
This won't be hard to implement, just a random chance of him spawning, but I
want the notification to be detailed, probably an ASCII drawing

Armor / Weapon / Magic equipping system:
Another entity mixin that'll just hold the currently equipped items and
functionality for equipping and unequipping items.

*UPDATE: armor and weapons working and equippable, need equipment menu.

Ranged attacks:
Could be triggered with shift + numpad keys. Whether or not the enemy dodges
the attack will be based on the skills of both the player and the enemy (need
skill system now). The movement of the projectile will be animated by moving the
projectile in the same direction by one until an enemy or a wall is hit.

Magic attacks:

Buff System:
Two types of buffs:
  Permanent Buffs (permaBuffs): can be purchased and upgraded with skill points
  (possibly in a UIMode separate from the skill menu)
  _____________________________________________________________________________
  Buff: effects gotten from eating food, drinking potions, being hit with a
  spell, or a sharp weapon that causes a bleeding effect.
  (possibly create another UIMode or layer to show active effects.)
  Basic idea: The player has a hash map of regular buffs where the key is the
  Buff and the value is the number of turns that the buff is still active
  every turn the player takes, the buffs are iterated through. They should have
  a method name 'affect' that will add whatever effects they have to the entity
  then their counter will be decreased.

Features wanted:
Either a menu to trade or a town that is visitable between levels.
Companion
New enemies:
  Goblins (fire damage, lasts for a few turns)
  Trolls
  Rats
  Slugs (acid damage, lasts for a few turns)
  Jackals
  Synths (ranged attakers)
